## Quick start

To access the app, you should open AiiDAlab platform first by either:

- Log into one of the [open AiiDAlab servers](https://www.aiidalab.net/deployments/).
- Run the AiiDAlab docker container directly [on your local machine](https://aiidalab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/index.html#usage-run-locally).

Once you are in the AiiDAlab platform, you can find the app in the App Store.
[Install it and launch it from there](https://aiidalab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/index.html#install-a-new-app).
